# Search Algorithms Exercises

## Overview
In this exercise, you'll practice two different implementations of the binary search algorithm:
* An interative implementation
* A recursive implementation

Both implementations are in the `searches.js` file. The "test" folder also has test scripts for both versions of the algorithm.

Make sure that you completed the myGA module for Search Algorithms (link) before completing these exercises.

> Note: the myGA module links out to Codepen for a code challenge on the binary search algorithm. **This exercise is the same as the one here, and is meant to help you prepare for the in class exercises.**
